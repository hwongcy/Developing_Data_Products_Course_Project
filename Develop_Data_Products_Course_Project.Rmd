## Overview

This Shiny App allows user to experience the Exponential Distribution and to compare with the Central Limited Theorem with corresponding Number of Samples, Number of Exponentials and Lambda.



## High Level Design

* **ui.R**
    + Number of Samples will be captured by using *sliderInput* between 1000 and 5000.
    + Number of Exponentials will be captured by using *sliderInput* between 10 and 50.
    + Lambda will be captured by using *selectInput* between 0.1 and 0.9.
    + A *submitButton* is used to send inputs to **server.R**.

* **server.R**
    + Exponential Distribution will be generated inside **server.R** according to the information captured in **ui.R**. 
    + The plot will be generated by *ggplot2* library and returned back to **ui.R**. 

* Please refer to **ui.R** and **server.R** for details.
